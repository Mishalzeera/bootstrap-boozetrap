    <h3>The corruption of a Decent man</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Namely, William Greaves of 76 Fosters Court</h4>
<br>
<br>
    <p>
        Mr. William Greaves of 76 Fosters Court <em>(see above Illustration)</em> was a respected hotelier in Clerkenwell. He was married to Mrs. Georgina Greaves <em>nee</em> Porter-Stakes of the influential Northumberland Porter-Stakes family. They lived a comfortable and Godly life. Near-teetotalers, they were frequently seen at their local parish church of St. Barnabas-on-the-fields. Friends of Mr. Greaves said the only Sin they had seen him fall prey to was the occasional impropriety with an Intemperate predisposition to the Eating of rich foods at inappropriate intervals, that gave unto himself the Appearance of a tendency to Gluttony.

    <br>

    <p>
        A heavy <em>FINE</em> was placed upon Mr. Greaves by HR Majesties Tax and Revenue, due to a long running <em>FEUDE</em> between Greaves and a Tax official named Mr. Frederick Wenslow. In this matter, Mr. Greaves was <em>entirely not at Faulte</em> which we, in our desire to express our compassionate and generouse hearted regard to the origin of his downfall, wish to convey.
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        In order to stay out of His Majesties Gaol Mr. Greaves was ordered to <em>Paye the Sum of Pounds Three Hundrede</em>. In order to achieve this he borrowed Sums from Friends and relations and sold his Cheshire home, which he had worked to earn by prodigiouse toil and the fullsome Sweate of his Browe.
    </p>

    <h3>Mr. Greaves First Sin was ANGER!!! and indignant BLAME!!!</h3>
    <p>In his brooding over his unfair Treatmente and also in no small parte due to his Shame and sense of Inadequate Masculine virtues, he withdrew from the confidences of his beloved wife Georgina. Insteade he took to the nearest Public House, still bedecked as he was in his Sundaye finery.</p>
