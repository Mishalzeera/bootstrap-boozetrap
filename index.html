        <h4>Our dilemma, most human and imperfect as we are:</h4>
        <br>

        <p>This weighty Coil troubles us - by its Incessant gulping at the Air, by it's cruelly implacable Hunger for Sustenance, and with malicious Diseases brought about by Impurities. There is no force to temper its bestial inclinations other than that of our imperfect and changeable human Will.</p>

        <p>The impulse and instinct of Men and Women is to seek refuge in pleasure as relief from their mighty Troubles.</p>

        <p>These instincts are fed and supported by places of foul repute, where excessive drinking, gamboling and far worse take place regularly and without respite.</p>

        <h4>Namely The Public Houses of Fair Englande!!!</h4>
        <br>


        <p>Let all who read this tale ponder and give weighty consideration to my humble and well-intentioned Reasoning.</p>

        <p>A sordid series of misdeeds will, as we shall passionately and adroitly endevoure to showe, surely follow our personal misfortunes, good reader. This is axiomatic and - yea even - incumbent upon us by our lower Nature, which, given free reign, seeks fulfilment entirely in those shallow and temporary pleasures shunned by the WISE. We blindly seek respite in the numbness and incoherency of the Drunken state while the yielding pliancy of the Flesh of others seduces our fancies, following which the allure of the gamboling table calls to us with its absorbing Mesmerism of adversarial, self-seeking Appeal.</p>
