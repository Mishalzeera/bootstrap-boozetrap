            In Gamboling, Mr. Greaves acquired as much as he was divestede of. The fever with which he was engripped was so as to incapacitate him for any useful function in his now former life. His beloved and faithful wife of noble birth and fine character, in proud but sorrowful determination, returned to the house of her family. His home was sold in absentia, upon Officiale order to pay the final sums of his debts to His Majesties Revenue.
