            In Gamboling, Mr. Greaves was in the dreaded momentus as he acquired less as he was divestede of. The fever
            with which he was engripped was so as to incapacitate him for any useful function in his now former life,
            that he was Loste to all those who had known him. His beloved and faithful wife of noble birth and fine
            character, in proud but sorrowful determination, returned to the house of her family. His hotel was sold in
            absentia, upon Officiale order to pay the final sums of his debts to His Majesties Revenue. His Childrene,
            yea even, effected <em>not to know him as they passed on the street</em> and he Reekede as his own infirmity
            caused him to soil his breeches.

            On his Third and Sixtieth anniversary, while at his diabolical Game, the Harlotes snowy bosom and maddening
            Waiste foremoste in his thoughts, there came a <em>terrible and grevious blast of HORNS from the river
                Thames!</em> Numerous of his cohort atteste with their own blackened Eyes to this Daye the sight of a
            terrible and Wrothful Angel, who, seizing the Fallen Greaves by his matted forelocke, growling mysterious
            syllables and dragging THE FALLEN GREAVES' unfortunate Soule away.
