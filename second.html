The pleasant feeling of intoxication was <em>by no means</em> a strong incentive upon his true and solid foundational character at firste. But, his association with the fallen types who frequented The Booze Trap Public House led to him developing and indulging his weak but nascent proclivity until it Manifestede as a regular indulgence of Stronge Gin with not any water.

                And then came the Pointe at which Fortune, having ascertained Mr. Greaves association with the Habits and Company of fallen people, assigned him Her most Wickede of tests.
