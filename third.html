        <h2>Encountering the <em>Harlote Jeanette De Blaise</em></h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr.Greaves, upon Castinge his lot with the Corruptor of the innocent, found himself often in the company of
            loose Women of negotiable Virtues. His open and personable Nature being what it was, he came soon the
            malicious Attentions of those Harlots who, upon setting their design regarding a man of means,
            <em>relenquish not their design until it has been fully executed</em>.
        </p>
        <p>Among these detestable Harpies was that Siren of uncontestable outer beauty, matched only by the depravity of
            her inner nature. The Siren, well known to all, who makes the very Whores of Hell blush in shame, was the
            Harlote Jeanette De Blaise.</p>

        <h4>the Harlote De Blaise and her unHoly desire for Wealth and Jeweles</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Harlote De Blaise, seeing that <em>taking the gifts of Besotted and undiscerning Gentleman was easier
                than working an honest trade</em>, had an Insatiable hunger and luste for Wealth and Jeweles. Ensnaring
            unwitting Public School boys of the upper class and divesting them of their pockete monies was indeed her
            daily Faire. For her own wicked Pleasures she enjoyed inflaming such as the former respected Gentleman Mr.
            Greaves, and trying her creative Endevoure to his Fates, bending and twisting opportune moments to her own
            Dark provenance - in hopes of a <em>spouting forth</em> of an ill-gotten streame of wealth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Favouring the Fallen Greaves with a kiss, the sight of a thigh, the scent of her Kercheife dipped as it was
            in potions to Emboggle and Infiltrate his very grip on sanity, she instilled in him the passionate wish to
            <em>acquire funds as quickly as possible</em>, which, as so often happens, drove him to Gamboling!
